# 5-Minute-Procrastination-Timer

What is the 5 Minute Procrastination Timer? It is based on what I call the 5 Minute Task Switch, a remedy for procrastination. How does this go? Simple! If you struggle with procrastination, and you need to get a bunch of stuff done, you can start the timer and do whatever your first task is for 5 minutes. When the bell rings, stop that task and start with the next one and do it again, for 5 minutes. If your last task to do for 5 minutes has finished, cycle back to your first task, and repeat.

This method will make you much more productive, as you are not doing one thing until it is done, but other things for roughly the same time. It will also keep you from getting bored or frustrated from doing one task, and keep your mind fresh.
